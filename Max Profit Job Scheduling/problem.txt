You are building a package delivery system where each delivery job is represented by a tuple containing three elements: the start time, end time, and profit. Your goal is to find the highest profit you can make by scheduling delivery jobs that do not overlap in time.
To achieve this, you need to choose a subset of jobs that fit together without any overlap in their time intervals, ensuring the total profit is maximized. This involves carefully selecting the jobs in a way that their scheduled times do not conflict while ensuring the cumulative profit from the selected jobs is as high as possible

Example
jobs = [(1, 3, 50), (3, 5, 20), (4, 6, 70), (6, 9, 60)]
Explanation: The maximum profit is 120 by scheduling jobs (1, 3, 50) and (4, 6, 70)

Function Description
Complete the function maxProfit
maxProfit has the following parameter(s):
: jobs which is a 2d - Array

Returns
int: maximum profit from non-overlapping delivery jobs
